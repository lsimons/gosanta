This is my first Go program. Go is a new experimental language from google:

	http://golang.org/

This program tries to implement The Santa Claus problem, which I learned about
reading the book Beautiful Code. Read about it online at

	http://www.crsr.net/Notes/SantaClausProblem.html

Unfortunately it does not really implement priorities properly as required by
the problem definition.

Compile:

	export GOROOT=...
	export GOARCH=amd64
	export GOOS=darwin
	./make.bash

Run:

	./santa

On my macbook, the results are something like this:

	$ time GOROOT=... GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=darwin ./make.bash                                  
	real    0m0.189s
	user    0m0.150s
	sys     0m0.035s

	$ time ./santa 
	2009/11/11 20:00:41 Done running around after 1000 runs, cleaning up!
	real    0m0.842s
	user    0m0.145s
	sys     0m0.173s
	
	$ time ./santa 
	2009/11/11 20:06:15 Done running around after 10000 runs, cleaning up!
	real    0m8.013s
	user    0m1.177s
	sys     0m1.598s
